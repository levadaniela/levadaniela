### Hi there 👋 I'm Daniela!

<!--
**levadaniela/levadaniela** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am a full-stack developer who has recently graduated from a 16-week coding bootcamp hosted by [School of Code](https://github.com/SchoolOfCode) Bootcamp 4.

My background spans around 7 years of experience successfully promoting and directing organic business initiative. In my desire to look for a new challenge in life I step into a new field and now I'm looking for an exciting career in tech.
